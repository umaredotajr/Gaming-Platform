# Decentralized Gaming Platform

A blockchain-based gaming ecosystem that enables true ownership of in-game assets, secure trading, competitive gaming, and cross-game asset compatibility.

## Overview

The Decentralized Gaming Platform consists of four core smart contracts that create an interconnected gaming ecosystem:

1. Game Asset Contract (NFTs)
2. Marketplace Contract
3. Tournament Contract
4. Cross-game Inventory Contract

## Core Features

### Game Asset Contract
- Implements ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards for game items
- Manages asset minting and burning
- Stores asset metadata and attributes
- Handles asset upgrades and modifications
- Supports batch transfers
- Implements asset rental functionality
- Manages asset durability and consumption

### Marketplace Contract
- Facilitates peer-to-peer trading of game assets
- Supports multiple payment tokens
- Implements auction mechanisms
- Manages listing creation and cancellation
- Handles escrow during trades
- Supports bundle sales
- Implements royalty distribution

### Tournament Contract
- Manages tournament creation and registration
- Handles prize pool distribution
- Implements tournament brackets
- Verifies game results
- Manages participant eligibility
- Supports multiple tournament formats
- Handles tournament scheduling

### Cross-game Inventory Contract
- Enables asset portability between games
- Manages asset compatibility rules
- Handles asset transformation between games
- Implements asset state synchronization
- Manages game integration permissions
- Supports asset metadata translation
- Handles cross-game achievements

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```

## Smart Contract Architecture

### Game Asset Contract
```solidity
interface IGameAsset {
    function mintAsset(address to, uint256 assetId, bytes memory data) external;
    function burnAsset(uint256 assetId) external;
    function upgradeAsset(uint256 assetId, bytes memory upgradeData) external;
    function getAssetDetails(uint256 assetId) external view returns (AssetDetails memory);
    function setAssetAttributes(uint256 assetId, bytes memory attributes) external;
}
```

### Marketplace Contract
```solidity
interface IMarketplace {
    function createListing(uint256 assetId, uint256 price) external;
    function cancelListing(uint256 listingId) external;
    function purchaseAsset(uint256 listingId) external payable;
    function createAuction(uint256 assetId, uint256 startingPrice) external;
    function placeBid(uint256 auctionId) external payable;
    function claimAuctionItem(uint256 auctionId) external;
}
```

### Tournament Contract
```solidity
interface ITournament {
    function createTournament(TournamentConfig memory config) external;
    function registerPlayer(uint256 tournamentId) external;
    function submitResult(uint256 matchId, bytes memory result) external;
    function distributePrizes(uint256 tournamentId) external;
    function getTournamentDetails(uint256 tournamentId) external view returns (TournamentDetails memory);
}
```

### Cross-game Inventory Contract
```solidity
interface ICrossGameInventory {
    function registerGame(address gameContract) external;
    function transferAssetToGame(uint256 assetId, address targetGame) external;
    function validateAssetCompatibility(uint256 assetId, address targetGame) external view returns (bool);
    function syncAssetState(uint256 assetId, bytes memory newState) external;
}
```

## Integration Guidelines

### For Game Developers
1. Implement required interfaces
2. Set up asset compatibility rules
3. Define asset transformation logic
4. Configure tournament integration
5. Set up marketplace compatibility

### For Players
1. Connect Web3 wallet
2. Acquire game assets
3. Participate in tournaments
4. Trade assets on marketplace
5. Manage cross-game inventory

## Security Features
